# pass_gen_redux
Program to generate passphrases like correcthorsebatterystaple.net - Remade with greater knowledge

A complete remake of my old and severely limited passphrase generator program, github.com/TungstenWhale/old-passphrasegen. Outputs a single passphrase to the terminal or generates a text file with many passphrases.

This project uses a list of English words by dwyl: github.com/dwyl/english-words.
